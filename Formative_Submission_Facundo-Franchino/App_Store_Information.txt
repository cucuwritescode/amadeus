AMADEUS - APP STORE INFORMATION
===============================

App Name: Amadeus
Tagline: Automatic Chord Recognition for Musicians

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Amadeus is a professional chord recognition app designed for musicians, producers, and music students. Using advanced machine learning and signal processing, it analyses audio files or live recordings to identify chord progressions, estimate musical keys, and provide comprehensive music theory resources.

KEY FEATURES
------------
• Audio Analysis: Import audio files or record up to 30 seconds for real-time analysis
• Chord Recognition: chord detection using Spotify's Basic Pitch with custom post-processing
• Key Detection: automatic key and mode estimation using Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm
• Real-time Playback: audio controls with independent speed and pitch adjustment
• Music Theory Library: documented database of 32+ chord types, scales, and progressions
• Practice Tools: timeline navigation, chord highlighting, and transposition
• Multiple Analysis Modes: HTTP server, CoreML local, and simulation mode
• Export Options: Share analysis results in text format (MIDI export planned)

TARGET AUDIENCE
---------------
Primary: Musicians (guitarists, pianists, composers)
Secondary: Music students and educators
Tertiary: Music producers and audio engineers

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
------------------------
• Platform: iOS 17.0+
• Languages: Swift, SwiftUI
• Dependencies: AudioKit 5.6.0, Tonic 1.0.6, Basic Pitch ML model
• Compatibility: iPhone, iPad
• Network: Optional (currently required for server-based analysis)

APP STORE CATEGORY
------------------
Primary: Music
Secondary: Education

PRICING STRATEGY
----------------
Freemium model:
• Free: Basic chord recognition, limited song analysis
• Pro: Unlimited analysis, advanced features, export options
• Educational: Discounted pricing for students and institutions, open-source on GitHub

KEYWORDS
--------
chord recognition, music theory, guitar chords, piano chords, key detection, music analysis, chord progression, music education, practice tool, songwriting, harmony, music production
